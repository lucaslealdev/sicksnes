# sick snes - Automatic Lockout Chip Toggle and In-Game Reset
![sick snes logo](images/logo.jpg)
## Overview
sick snes is a mod for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) that allows automatic lockout chip toggling and in-game reset functionality. If a cartridge fails the CIC (Check-In Chip) check, the mod disables the CIC and resets the console automatically.

### Features
- **Automatic lockout chip toggle**
- **In-game reset functionality** using controller input
- **Compatibility with all SNES consoles**
- **LED indicators** for CIC status

### Controls
- рџ”„ **Soft Reset:** Press `L + R + START + LEFT`
- рџ”„ **Long Reset:** Press `L + R + START + DOWN` (Some flashcarts only return to the menu with long reset)
- рџ”’ **Forcefully Disable CIC:** Press `L + R + START + RIGHT`

## Installation Guide
### Wiring Instructions
Connect the Arduino to the SNES board as follows:

| Arduino Pin | SNES Connection   |
|------------|------------------|
| `5V`       | `Board VCC`       |
| `GND`      | `Board GND`       |
| `D4`       | `Reset Button`    |
| `D5`       | `CIC Pin 1`       |
| `D6`       | `Green LED`       |
| `D7`       | `Red LED`         |
| `D8`       | `CIC Pin 4**`     |
| `A0`       | `Controller Pin 10` |
| `A1`       | `Controller Pin 8`  |
| `A2`       | `Controller Pin 6`  |

**Note:** CIC Pin 4 must be disconnected (lifted) for proper operation.

## Programming Instructions
To flash the Arduino with this mod, follow these steps:

### Standard Flashing via USB
1. Connect the Arduino to your computer via USB.
2. Use the Arduino IDE or a similar tool to upload the firmware.
3. If using a bootloader, some consoles may require a manual reset workaround for *Street Fighter Alpha 2* (see below).

### Flashing Without Bootloader (For Faster Boot)
For some consoles, *Street Fighter Alpha 2* may require a faster startup. To achieve this:
1. Use an external programmer (e.g., USBasp) to flash the Arduino without a bootloader.
2. This ensures the Arduino starts before the cartridge, avoiding conflicts.

### Workaround for *Street Fighter Alpha 2* (If Bootloader is Used)
If the Arduino is flashed via USB (with a bootloader), and *Street Fighter Alpha 2* does not boot properly on your console:
- Hold the **reset button** until the Arduino initializes (~1.8s after power-up). This allows the game to start *after* the Arduino executes its code.

**Note:** This issue is rare and only affects *Street Fighter Alpha 2* on certain SNES consoles.

## Already tested  

| SNES Model         | With bootloader (via usb) | No bootloader (USBasp) |
